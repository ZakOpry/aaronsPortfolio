            Hi there. I'm Tug, and I kind of have a thing for story telling, and
            would love to tell yours. The day my wife and I got married, I was a
            nervous WRECK. It was a long day to say the least. Between dealing
            with my emotions, finally saying I do, and celebrating with our
            friends and family, I was exhausted. And before I knew it, it was
            over. Just like that. One of the happiest days of my life; as slow
            as it came was as quick as it went. With all the chaos and
            excitement of the day, I didn't quite remember all the details like
            I had hoped, and I was pretty sad about it to be honest. That
            feeling drove me to create what I call, Tug Films. I want you to
            have the opportunity to relive all of the special moments from your
            big day for years to come, and be able to share your perfectly
            curated story with the people that mean the most to you. I'm a very
            laid back person, easy to talk to, and I really look forward to
            hearing about your story.{" "}
